Function

    Write a Program in C to input a number and find whether the number is exactly divisible by 5 and 7 or not using functions:

        No return no argument

        No return with argument

        Return with no argument

        Return with argument

    WAP in C to input a number and check whether the number is palindrome or not using function.
    WAP in C to find whether the given number is prime or not using function
    WAP in C to print all prime number less than 500 using function
    WAP in C to print print TWIN PRIME less than 500 using function. [if two consecutive odd numbers are both prime then they are known as twin prime].
